# üîß Bug Fix: Missing google-generativeai Module

## ‚ùå **Error Found**
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'google.generativeai'
```

## üõ†Ô∏è **Fixed Issues**

### 1. **Missing Dependency Fix**
The main issue was that the `google-generativeai` package wasn't installed. I've updated `utils/gemini_service.py` to handle this gracefully:

```python
# Optional import for Google Generative AI
try:
    import google.generativeai as genai
    GENAI_AVAILABLE = True
except ImportError:
    genai = None
    GENAI_AVAILABLE = False
    print("‚ÑπÔ∏è google-generativeai not installed. Using fallback messages only.")
```

### 2. **Graceful Degradation**
The app now works even without the Google AI package installed:
- Shows informative messages about missing dependencies
- Falls back to built-in cute messages
- All other features (animations, interactions) work normally

## üöÄ **Solutions**

### **Option 1: Install the AI Package (Recommended)**
```bash
pip install google-generativeai
```

### **Option 2: Use Without AI (Works Now)**
The app will run with built-in messages only - no installation needed!

## ‚úÖ **Test the Fix**
After undoing the corrupted changes to pet.py, the app should now start successfully and show:
```
‚ÑπÔ∏è google-generativeai not installed. Using fallback messages only.
‚úÖ Milk Mocha Pet started successfully!
```

## üéØ **Additional Fixes Applied**
1. **Duplicate Code**: Removed duplicate timer cleanup code in position_speech_bubble()
2. **Character Encoding**: Fixed malformed character (ÔøΩ) in error message  
3. **Import Safety**: Made Google AI import optional with proper error handling

The pet will now work perfectly with cute built-in messages, and you can optionally install the AI package later for enhanced features!
